# Effective Strategies for Online Learning

This document was adapted from material originally posted during the Covid-19 Pandemic by the UCSB Office of Instructional Development.  [The original source

Taking an online class when you are used to in-person classes means a transition in learning environments, approaches, and strategies. 
We’ve compiled some tips and resources to help you become a successful online learner. 
Please remember to be patient with yourself, your classmates, and your instructors.

# Getting Started

Before you begin, consider the following:

* **Learning space**: Do you have the environment you need to focus and work? Consider establishing a designated work space and making it as comfortable as possible. Limited on space and quiet? Use headphones and quiet background music that might help you focus. YouTube is a good option for free study music – the ONDAS Student Center and Transfer Student Center peers love [LoFi hip hop radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A).
* **Learning tools**: All UCSB students have access to the G Suite: Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Hangouts, and more. Familiarize yourself with these useful learning and social tools, and remember to check your email every day. GauchoSpace or Canvas will house material for most, if not all, of your courses. Zoom can be used for classes, office hours, and group meetings. This site also offers tips for GauchoSpace and Zoom.
* **Computer**: You will need access to a computer, ideally with camera capabilities. If you find yourself without access to a computer, this link may have some helpful resources for loaner computers available to UCSB Students: <https://food.ucsb.edu/resources/technology-resources>
* **Reliable Internet**: Make sure you will have access to reliable internet.
* **Syllabi**: Read your syllabus for each class carefully! Each class will have its own requirements. 
  Be sure to check whether your class is meeting live on Zoom/other technology (synchronous) or if you are expected to 
  complete the course material at your own pace (asynchronous). 
  Make sure to pay close attention to your deadlines. For help understanding your syllabi, visit [CLAS](https://clas.sa.ucsb.edu/) and view the workshop titled [Learning Online: Three Exercises](https://prezi.com/view/3Qz8hPAb5lRYIx23vUgI/).
