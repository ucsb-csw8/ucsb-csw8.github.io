# Effective Strategies for Online Learning

This document was adapted from material originally posted during the Covid-19 Pandemic by the [UCSB Office of Instructional Development](https://id.ucsb.edu).  [The original source

Taking an online class when you are used to in-person classes means a transition in learning environments, approaches, and strategies. 
We’ve compiled some tips and resources to help you become a successful online learner. 
Please remember to be patient with yourself, your classmates, and your instructors.

# Getting Started

Before you begin, consider the following:

* **Learning space**: Do you have the environment you need to focus and work? Consider establishing a designated work space and making it as comfortable as possible. Limited on space and quiet? Use headphones and quiet background music that might help you focus. YouTube is a good option for free study music – the ONDAS Student Center and Transfer Student Center peers love [LoFi hip hop radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A).
* **Learning tools**: All UCSB students have access to the G Suite: Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Hangouts, and more. Familiarize yourself with these useful learning and social tools, and remember to check your email every day. GauchoSpace or Canvas will house material for most, if not all, of your courses. Zoom can be used for classes, office hours, and group meetings. This site also offers tips for GauchoSpace and Zoom.
* **Computer**: You will need access to a computer, ideally with camera capabilities. If you find yourself without access to a computer, this link may have some helpful resources for loaner computers available to UCSB Students: <https://food.ucsb.edu/resources/technology-resources>
* **Reliable Internet**: Make sure you will have access to reliable internet.
* **Syllabi**: Read your syllabus for each class carefully! Each class will have its own requirements. 
  Be sure to check whether your class is meeting live on Zoom/other technology (synchronous) or if you are expected to 
  complete the course material at your own pace (asynchronous). 
  Make sure to pay close attention to your deadlines. For help understanding your syllabi, visit [CLAS](https://clas.sa.ucsb.edu/) and view the workshop titled [Learning Online: Three Exercises](https://prezi.com/view/3Qz8hPAb5lRYIx23vUgI/).

Exploring New Study Habits
</summary>
 
Learning online will likely mean you need to practice study habits that differ to ones practiced during face-to-face instruction. Below are some suggested strategies and tools to try out for online learning:

* Exercises for online learning from CLAS: logon to [myCLAS](https://myclas.sa.ucsb.edu/login.aspx) and search for the Academic Skills workshop titled Learning Online: Three Exercises.
* Reading effectively using the [SQ3R method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ona44EaMSv4)
* Distributed practice: Break up your studying into short sessions distributed across time - the opposite of cramming at the last minute.
* Practice testing: Getting something wrong can help you retain the right answer. The best practice tests are the ones that force you to do free recall, not just recognize the right answer. More practice tests are better than fewer.
* Self-explanation: Having to explain to yourself why something is correct or how information fits together significantly aids learning. The practice of relating it to other information makes this different from just summarizing.

Essentials of Time Management
</summary>
 
Remote learning might mean that you have less structure in your day. It's very tempting to sleep in each day and put off tasks until you really have to do them. However, that is not an effective way to manage your time or facilitate your learning.

Use your Google Calendar and create some structure for your time. Having a routine and entering it into your calendar is helpful for tracking whether you're also taking care of your mental and physical health. Breaks, exercise, and fresh air are necessary!

The ONDAS Student Center Peer Mentors offer helpful advice in these videos:

* [Time Management during Remote Instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wjz522Ybak)
* [Getting Organized](https://youtu.be/EUv9iU4-C4s)
* [How to Use Your Google Calendar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daPu_IpIDl8)

Note-taking for Online Courses
</summary>
 
Everyone has their own preferences for note-taking, but you may want to try different strategies for an online course.

Just because you can rewatch a video or look at slides online doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take notes. Otherwise, you’ll just be re-reading or rewatching a lot, which isn’t a very effective learning technique. 

You'll most likely be using a single screen, so you'll have to balance viewing your video/participating in discussion with note-taking. Many guides about online learning recommend you take handwritten notes to vary the media you are using. You can pause videos and note timestamps in your notes to return to spots later.

Learn new strategies by viewing the following presentation:

Mindfulness Techniques for Remote Learning
</summary>
 
Now, more than ever, it's important to take care of ourselves and our mental health. At times, this experience may get frustrating and stressful, but we know you'll get through this. Below are resources for incorporating mindfulness into the remote learning experience from Dr. Virginia Beaufort, Director of the Undergraduate Mentorship Program. 
 
**Mindfulness Techniques for Concentration & Focus:**

* [Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GisVmPtERpY&feature=youtu.be)
* [Mindfulness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFaQqh1XVc4)

Importance of Connections
</summary>
 
Remote learning might feel isolating, but it doesn't have to be a lonely experience. We highly recommend staying connected to your instructors, classmates, friends, and family during this time. It's important to feel connection and community.

Participate in class discussions, online forums, and virtual office hours. Contribute your ideas and don't be afraid to ask questions! Most likely, you're asking a question that someone else also has.

Online study groups are possible! Connect with classmates through GauchoSpace and form accountability buddies. Having a friend to discuss assignments, review material, and work through main points is important. Consider using one of the following to connect with others:

* Zoom 
* Google Hangouts
* FaceTime
* WhatsApp
* GroupMe

The ONDAS Student Center Peer Mentors have a video with
[tips on how to form and structure a virtual study group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq8VVLAlfxM&t=2s).

Student organizations can also be a way to form connections. For more information on student orgs, visit [Shoreline (information on events and registered student groups)](https://shoreline.ucsb.edu/home_login)

<summary>
Using Email
</summary>
 
It's important to check your UCSB email daily. You'll want to pay attention to emails from your instructors but also notifications that you may be receiving from GauchoSpace and other online learning tools.

Compose clear email messages and practice good email etiquette. In a large course, your professor might be receiving a high volume of emails. Please note that it may take some time for your professors to get back to you.

Email tips:

First, if your instructor has asked you to use something other than email (e.g. Piazza, Slack, a Gauchospace or Canvas forum), please try that first.

If you are sending an email:

* Use your UCSB email address
* Address your instructor professionally
* Tell them your name and what class you are in
* State your question or request
* If appropriate, state what you would like to see happen
* End with a salutation
* Sign your full name

Here's an example email demonstrating these tips:
